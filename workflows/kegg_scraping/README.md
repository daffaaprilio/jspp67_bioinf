# HMM Homology workflow
Fortunately, we have access to databases such as KEGG, that is proven to be useful in the case of searching for the gene consituents of our pathway of intereset: the TAA biosynthetic pathway.

Although some key genes might not be available yet in the database, we can infer the TAA biosynthetic pathway cluster by looking at its adjacent pathway cluster, which in this case, the TCA cycle.

This workflow consists of code(s) to automatically obtain genes related to TCA cyle from KEGG FTP.
